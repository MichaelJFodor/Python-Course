# PROBLEM 1)
# Below is a short section of genomic DNA:
# It comprises two exons and an intron.
# The first exon runs from the start of the sequence to base number 63 (starting counting from zero),
#   and the second exon runs from base 91 (also counting from zero) to the end of the sequence.
# Write a program that will print just the coding regions of the DNA sequence.
my_dna = 'ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAGTCATAGCTATGCATGTAGCTACTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTATCATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACTACTAT'




# PROBLEM 2)
# Using the data from part one, write a program that will calculate what percentage of the DNA sequence is exons.


# PROBLEM 3)
# Using the data from part one,
# Write a program that will print out the original genomic DNA sequence with coding bases in uppercase and
#   non-coding bases in lowercase.


# PROBLEM 4)
# Print this pyramid image to the console
