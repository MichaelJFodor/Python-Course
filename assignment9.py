#Part 1: Create a fucntion named "Find Sum"
# Input: Two Int numbers
# Output: One Int, the sum of those two numbers


#Part 2: Create a function named "Find Product"
# Input: Two Int numbers
# Output: One Int, the product of those two numbers


#Part 3: Create a function named "Find List Sum"
# Input: One List
# Output: One Int, the sum of every number in that list
# numbers = [5, 7, 3, 6, 9, 1, 6, 33, 52, 0, 5, -1, 7]


#Part 4: Create a function named "is All Positive"
# Input: One List
# Output: One Bool, returns True if all numbers are positive; False if any numbers are negative
# You NEED to use loops and conditionals for this problem.
# numbers = [5, 7, 3, 6, 9, 1, 6, 33, 52, 0, 5, -1, 7]


#Part 5: Challenge: Create a function named "Count Base"
# Input: Two strings: the dna sequence, and one base
# Output: One Int: the number of a bases inside of a dna sequence
# Use the code written for you below (remove the # comments)
# You NEED to use loops and conditionals for this problem. You may not use string's count() function

#my_dna = 'ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTATTTGCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT'
#number_of_g = count_base(my_dna, 'G')
#number_of_a = count_base(my_dna, 'A')
#number_of_t = count_base(my_dna, 'T')
#number_of_c = count_base(my_dna, 'C')
#print('G Count' + str(number_of_g))
#print('A Count' + str(number_of_a))
#print('T Count' + str(number_of_t))
#print('C Count' + str(number_of_c))
