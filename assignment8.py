# Part 1: Print every element in this list using a WHILE loop, FOR (range), and FOR (each) 
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Part 2: Using a WHILE loop, make two lists, one containing all even numbers and other containing all odd numbers from numbers from 0 to n.
# The variable n is provided from the user via the console
# example for input:     n = input('This is a message to the user:\n')



# Part 3 (Remember type(x)): 
# The following list has 3 different types (int, float, string). 
# Create 3 new empty lists for each of the three types 
# If the element in the original list is an INT type, add it to the INT list
# OR IF the element in the original list is an FLOAT type, add it to the FLOAT list
# OR IF the element in the original list is an STRING type, add it to the STRING list
