### PART 1 ###
# What would the following print? Uncomment to see your answer

# print("101 % 1=", 101%1)
# print("101 % 10=", 101%10)
# print("101 % 100=", 101%100)
# print("101 % 1000=", 101%1000)

a = 5
a %= 7
#print(a)

b = 12
b %= a
#print(b)

c = 5
c %= b + 1
#print(c)


### PART 2 ###
# Define a list named "Animal Cell"
# Initialize it with the data: "Mito", "Golgi", "Ribos", "Nucleus", "E.R.", and "Lysos"
# REMEMBER you use [brackets] to define a list

# Create an variable named "i" and initialize it to 0 (i in this case is short for "index" which tracks the index
#   of each value in your list)


# Print every element of "Animal Cell" to the console using the "i" variable (you will need to use + )

# Challenge: Without creating a new list, how can you append a new value to the back of your list in Python3?
# Append "Perox" to your already existing list


### PART 3 ###
# Define a list named "Sugar List" and initialize it with the values "Dex", "Fruct", "Gluc", "Lact", "Sucr" and "Malt"

# Define a variable named "My Fav Ose" and assign it the value of your favorite choice using the [] operator

# Find the length of the Sugar List and assign it to a variable.

# Challenge: Using the variable you just make (of list size), print to the console the last element in Sugar List
#   without creating a new variable!


### PART 4 ###
# Define a variable named "User Name" and initialize it to: "Bob"
# Define a variable named "Password" and initialize it to: "123abc"
# Define a variable named "Zip" and initialize it to: 12345 <-- an int, not a string!
# Define a variable named "In College" and initialize it to: False
# Define a variable named "Coolness Level" and initialize it to: 3.6

# Challenege: Define a variable named "Account List" and initialize it to contain the values using only the variables you
#   defined from above

# Find the length of the list and store it in a variable

# Print to the console the entire list using only one variable name

# Access the last element of the list using the [] operator and your length variable, and change its value to 4.6 but
#   not create a new variable

# Print to the console the entire list using only one variable name (Ensure that the last element is now 4.6)
