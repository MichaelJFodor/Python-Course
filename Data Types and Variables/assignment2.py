### Part 1 ### Casting
# Create a variable named “Number of Colors” and assign it the integer value 3

# Multiply Number of Colors by 5, and store it in a variable named “More Colors”

# Divide More Colors by 10 and store it into a variable named “Fraction Of Colors”

# Cast Fraction of Colors into an integer and store it into a variable named “Whole Color”

# Cast Whole Color into a boolean and store it into a variable named “Is Color”

# Challenge: Print to the console the type of EACH variable you wrote, the Name of each variable, and the value of each variable using ONLY 5 print statements, and NO new variables.

### Part 2 ### Operators
# You are not allowed to create any new variables; you must reuse the variable x
# You are given x = 5, make use of the += operator to make x equal to 7, then print x

# Use -= to make x equal to 2 , then print x

# Use **= to make x equal to 8 , then print x

# Use /= to make x equal to 4 , then print x

### Part 3 ### Strings
# Create a variable named “User Name” and assign it the the string of YOUR name

# Find out how to use the len() function. Try searching “How to use len() in Python”. Make a variable named “Name Length” and assign it the length of your name.

# Create a variable named “Start Intro” and assign it the value “Hello! My Name is”

# Create a variable named “Middle Intro” and assign it the value “, and my name is exactly”

# Create a variable named “End Intro” and assign it the value “letters long!”

# Using only one print statement, print a statement to the console that reads “Hello! My name is Michael , and my name is exactly 7 letters long!”, but using only the 5 variables you created.



### Part 4 ### More operators
# Make variable mol_0 = 0.09
# Make variable mol_1 = 0.12
# Make variable mol_2 = 0.2
# Make variable liters_0 = 0.8
# Make variable liters_1 = 0.5
# Make variable liters_2 = 1.0

# Store the molarity from each number pair (mol_0, liters_0,...mol_1, liters_1,....) into variables named molarity_0, molarity_1, and molarity_2.

# Convert each volume based variable into mL and name them mL_0, mL_1, mL_2 (you must use arithmetic operations and the liters variables, you cannot simply set these mL variables to be the answer.

# Cast each mL variable into an int


### Part 5 ### Logic
bool t = True
bool f = False

# Guess what the following will print!
print(t and t)
print(t and 1)
print(t and f)
print(not t)
print(not f)
print(f or t)
print(f or 0)
print(t or f)
print(f and t)
print(t or t)
